This is a python program to extract address book, sms, and photos from Itunes backup. The script for address book and messages produce files that can be imported on Android phones. Photos are organized by in folders: a folder for each month.

To use:

python working_extractor.py -p PATH_TO_YOUR_BACKUP

Execute the script without path arugment and it will display the possible location of your backup files according to your platform.

I am planning to integrate the extraction of notes and whatsapp messages in near future.
