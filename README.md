This is a python program to extract address book, sms, and photos from Itunes backup. The script for address book and messages produce files that can be imported on Android phones. Photos are organized in folders: a folder for each month.

To use:

python working_extractor.py -p PATH_TO_YOUR_BACKUP

Execute the script without the path arugment and it will display the possible location of your backup files according to your platform.

Recently my iphone stopped working due to water spill and I was left only with a backup on my mac. I found several tools online but they were quite expensive and I found several scripts for one thing or another but nothing doing the whole. I am planning to integrate the extraction of notes and whatsapp messages in near future.
